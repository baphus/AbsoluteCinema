**AbsoluteCinema** is a web-based movie ticket booking system developed as a final project for our CC225 - Information Management course at Cebu Technological University.

## 📌 Project Overview

AbsoluteCinema was built to solve common issues in manual ticketing systems such as long queues, double bookings, and scheduling conflicts. The system supports both customer and admin roles:

- **Customers** can register, browse movies, view showtimes, check seat availability, book tickets, and view their booking history.
- **Admins** can manage movie records, screen configurations, showtimes, bookings, and user data through an intuitive dashboard.

## 👨‍💻 My Learning Journey

I started this project with very limited knowledge about PHP and databases. I searched *"PHP full course"* on YouTube and began learning the basics. With time and experimentation, especially on form handling and login systems, I was able to implement everything from the login page to a full admin dashboard.

Despite the project requiring only a basic login-logout flow, I went further and created full admin control features, UI translations from team designs, and functional user flows. This project made me realize I enjoy building full systems and interfaces.
